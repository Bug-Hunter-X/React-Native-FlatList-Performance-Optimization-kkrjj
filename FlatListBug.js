This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue manifests as slow scrolling, lag, or even crashes.  The root cause is often inefficient rendering or data handling.  Specifically, the keyExtractor prop might be improperly configured or missing, leading to inefficient key generation and re-renders.  Also, the data itself might not be optimally structured for efficient rendering, potentially resulting in many unnecessary re-renders of items that haven't changed. Another common problem is using renderItem function that performs complex operations, thus creating performance bottleneck.
